THIS IS JUST A COPY OF TAB SUSPENDER. which is maybe the lesss functional of the two interms of background processing.

but more modern in js , fwiw...


maybe grab some tailwind and react for this? but really i just want it to work.

reload and bonus for kill suspend.  
quick impl could have a button for reload every 3 mins, and a stretch a button for kill suspend. but i might be runing out of advisable steam tonight,


htmx?
