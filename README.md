THIS IS JUST A COPY OF TAB SUSPENDER. which is maybe the lesss functional of the two interms of background processing.

but more modern in js , fwiw...


maybe grab some tailwind and react for this? but really i just want it to work.

reload and bonus for kill suspend.  
quick impl could have a button for reload every 3 mins, and a stretch a button for kill suspend. but i might be runing out of advisable steam tonight,


htmx?



ok, gonna start with v3 manifest. for quick dev. later, move to v3.


oh, but maybe suspender is v3?  steal from there. for now, get a thing going.  eh, the apis differ. easier to go with 3?
